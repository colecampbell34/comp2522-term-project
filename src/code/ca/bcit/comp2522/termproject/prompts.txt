"can you generate a wordle game for me in java, using simple javafx" was my first prompt
from here i looked things over and slowly asked for improvements, building up to a multiplayer wordle game.
i would usually ask the ai to reference the comp2522 curriculum and only use things available there.
after about 5 solid iterations i was left with the base for a multiplayer wordle game that i felt was viable to
use and build off of.
after all the ai work, i had to go in and find all of the uses from each lecture, and add some that were missed,
for example there was nothing from lecture 6 used, so i made the player class an inner class.
after adding all of my own things, changing the style to suit the classes best practices, and thoroughly testing,
i then used a different ai and asked it to proofread and look for any errors in the code.
it was able to find some problems and helped me fix them, which showed me the importance of cross referencing.

the upsides:
- saves an unbelievable amount of time
- spots minor bugs that i would have missed
- comes up with ways to use certain criteria and mix it into my game
- can give me multiple iterations of code to see which version i like best
- can reference websites and textbooks instantly

the downsides:
- can make lots of mistakes
- hard to deal with sometimes because i have to re-explain everything multiple times
- some models of chatgpt are better than others, and i get limited access to the better models with the free version
- default code style does not align with our classes best practices
